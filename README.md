# Welcome to Group Group 03's Online Grocery Store

[![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2022/project-group-group-03/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2022/project-group-group-03/actions/workflows/main.yml)

## Project Scope
This is an online Grocery Store Software System made for Dr. Kanaan's Grocery Store, using the Agile methodology. 
This Software System allows customers to create an account which they can use to buy products from their favourite grocery store. 
Customers can buy products from the ease of their home by having it delivered to their address. However, an option for them to pick up their groceries from 
an in-store location is also available if they wish to do so. The system will be mainly managed by the owner Dr. Kanaan. He can hire and fire employees from this system, while also allowing him to manage his employee's schedules. 
He can also decide the business hours of the store as well as occasions of holidays. 

## Deploying the project as a Heroku application
### Backend 

 ##### Backend App Name  
grocerystore-backend-ise2022w 
 ##### Database URL 
jdbc:postgresql://ec2-3-91-127-228.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/daaah13ecc2e9c?password=1766bd0bda93b6655add493bb145aa4dd24414a48a00e8466b9c95b9774f155c&sslmode=require&user=vdgjvdmjzreell

##### How to run this project
To run the project, clone this repository and run the java file `GroceryStoreBackendApplication.java`  \
locally as a  `Spring Boot Application`. 

This will deploy the backend [here](http://localhost:8080/). 

Heroku hosts the backend [here](https://grocerystore-backend-ise2022w.herokuapp.com/) once deployed.
